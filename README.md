# Fibonacci-Sequence
By Jason Yao

## Description
A repo showing different implementations of generating the nth fibonacci number. Overarching computing principles involved:

- Recursion VS Iterative approach (Recursion has a more elegant solution sometimes, while iterative has faster runtime due to much fewer stack frame calls)

- Dynamic Programming (memoization of prior calculations for future use, only useful for recursion, since iterative already uses an even faster method)

- Direct algorithmic Solving (A specific algorithm has been shown to be able to generate the nth fibonacci number, though accuracy decreases as n goes up)
