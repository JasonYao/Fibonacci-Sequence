# Fibonacci-Sequence
By Jason Yao

## Description
A repo showing different implementations of generating the nth fibonacci number. Overarching computing principles involved:

- [Recursion vs Iterative approach](naive) (Recursion has a more elegant solution sometimes, while iterative has faster runtime due to much fewer stack frame calls)

- [Dynamic Programming](dynamic) (memoization of prior calculations for future use, only useful for recursion, since iterative already uses an even faster method)

- [Direct algorithmic Solving](direct) (A specific algorithm has been shown to be able to generate the nth fibonacci number, though accuracy decreases as n goes up)
